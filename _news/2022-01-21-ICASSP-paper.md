Congratulations to my MSc student Daan for geeting a paper at [ICASSP 2022](https://2022.ieeeicassp.org/)! The paper "Wave-Domain Approach For Cancelling Noise Entering Open Windows" is the outcome of an excellent [thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:df67aba2-2edd-4a87-b65c-3ce50e904045) supervised by prof. Bastiaan Kleijn and co-supervised by me.
