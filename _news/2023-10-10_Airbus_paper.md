Making an #aircraft lighter is one way towards #sustainable #aviation. But what if faults cause extra loads mid-flight on such lighter structure? In this award winning paper by [Twan](_projects/people/former/5_Twan_Keijzer.md), Japie Engelbrecht (Stellenbosch University), Philippe Goupil (Airbus) and myself we show how to detect them in as short as 0.1 seconds!





The algorithm behind "[A sliding mode observer approach to oscillatory fault detection in commercial aircraft](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conengprac.2023.105719)" was **awarded first prize** in the [Aerospace Industrial Benchmark contest organised by Airbus at IFAC 2020](https://research.tudelft.nl/en/prizes/first-prize-at-the-aerospace-industrial-benchmark-on-fault-detect)
