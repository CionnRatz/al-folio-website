:champagne: Three paper accepted to [ECC 2024](https://ecc24.euca-ecc.org) in Stokholm :sweden:! Congratulations to: 
Yang for "Concurrent Li-ion Battery Parameter Estimation and Open-Circuit Voltage Reconstruction via L1-Regularized Least Squares ", this is his first paper with prof. Verhaegen and myself; Wolfram for "Transient Solutions of the Fokker-Planck Equation using a Galerkin-Method with Weighted Test Functions", first paper that we wrote on the problem of uncertainty propagation in nonlinear dynamical systems; Luca for "Control of reaction-diffusion processes under communication delays", written before joining us with J. Arbelaiz, V. Gupta, L. Schenato, and M. R. Jovanovic.
