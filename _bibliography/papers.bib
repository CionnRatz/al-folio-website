  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

	volume = {57},
	year = {2012},
	abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of designing a distributed fault detection and isolation methodology for nonlinear uncertain large-scale discrete-time dynamical systems. As a divide et impera approach is used to overcome the scalability issues of a centralized implementation, the large scale system being monitored is modelled as the interconnection of several subsystems. The subsystems are allowed to overlap, thus sharing some state components. For each subsystem, a Local Fault Diagnoser is designed, based on the measured local state of the subsystem as well as the transmitted variables of neighboring states that define the subsystem interconnections. The local diagnostic decision is made on the basis of the knowledge of the local subsystem dynamic model and of an adaptive approximation of the interconnection with neighboring subsystems. The use of a specially-designed consensus-based estimator is proposed in order to improve the detectability and isolability of faults affecting variables shared among overlapping subsystems. Theoretical results are provided to characterize the detection and isolation capabilities of the proposed distributed scheme. Finally, simulation results are reported showing the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},
