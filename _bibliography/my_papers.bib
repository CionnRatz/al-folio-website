	abstract = {Wind turbines are prone to structural degradation, particularly in offshore locations. Based on the structural health condition of the tower, power de-rating strategies can be used to reduce structural loads at the cost of power losses. This paper introduces a novel closed-loop switching control architecture to constrain the thrust in individual turbines. By taking inspiration from developments in the field of reference governors, an existing demanded power tracking controller is extended by a thrust tracking controller. The latter is activated only when a user-defined constraint on fore-aft thrust force is exceeded, which can be set based on the actual damage status of the turbine. Having a down-regulation with monotonic aerodynamic load response, a simple linear thrust tracking controller is proposed. Such a scheme can reduce aerodynamic loads while incurring acceptable losses on power production which, in a wind farm setting, can be compensated for by other turbines. Large eddy simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme on satisfying thrust constraints.},

	abstract = {Individual Pitch Control (IPC) is an effective control strategy to mitigate the blade loads on large-scale wind turbines. Since IPC usually requires high pitch actuation, the safety constraints of the pitch actuator should be taken into account when designing the controller. This paper introduces a constrained Subspace Predictive Repetitive Control (SPRC) approach, which considers the limitation of blade pitch angle and pitch rate. To fulfill this goal, a model predictive control scheme is implemented in the fully data-driven SPRC approach to incorporate the physical limitations of the pitch actuator in the control problem formulation. An optimal control law subjected to constraints is then formulated so that future constraint violations are anticipated and prevented. Case studies show that the developed constrained SPRC reduces the pitch activities necessary to mitigate the blade loads when experiencing wind turbulence and abrupt wind gusts. More importantly, the approach allows the wind farm operator to design conservative bounds for the pitch actuator constraints that satisfies safety limitations, design specifications and physical restrictions. This will help to alleviate the cyclic fatigue loads on the actuators, increase the structural reliability and extend the lifespan of the pitch control system.},

	abstract = {The estimation of the rotor effective wind speed is used in modern wind turbines to provide advanced power and load control capabilities. However, with the ever increasing rotor sizes, the wind field over the rotor surface shows a higher degree of spatial variation. A single effective wind speed estimation therefore limits the attainable levels of load mitigation, and the estimation of the Blade Effective Wind Speed (BEWS) might present opportunities for improved load control. This letter introduces two novel BEWS estimator approaches: A Proportional Integral Notch (PIN) estimator based on individual blade load measurements, and a Coleman estimator targeting the estimation in the non-rotating frame. Given the seeming disparities between these two estimators, the objective of this letter is to analyze the similarities between the approaches. It is shown that the PIN estimator, which is equivalent to the diagonal form of the Coleman estimator, is a simple but effective method to estimate the BEWS. The Coleman estimator, which takes the coupling effects between individual blades into account, shows a more well behaved transient response than the PIN estimator.},

Here we present a new instrumentation systems family , named Q-V I D , capable of accurate measurements of hot and cold products by groundbreaking and robust computer vision techniques, specifically designed to fit accuracy and real-time constraints.
We will describe its convenience with respect to more traditional, application-specific optical measuring approaches, and provide three real-world examples:
* an overview of a full system with tight deployment constraints, to show how the Q-VID modules can be deployed in out-of-reach plant infrastructure in a distributed fashion with no particular efforts;

	abstract = {Abstract Over the past decades, Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) has gained increasing attention in wind engineering due to the rapidly growing energy demands. However, difficulties in turbine maintenance will increase due to the harsh operational conditions. Fault diagnosis techniques play a crucial role to enhance the reliability of FOWTs and reduce the cost of offshore wind energy. In this paper, a novel data-driven fault diagnosis method using regularized dynamic canonical correlation analysis (RDCCA) and Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) is proposed for FOWTs. Specifically, to overcome the collinearity problem that exists in measured process data, dynamic canonical correlation analysis with a regularization scheme, is developed to exploit the relationship between input and output signals. Then, the residual signals are generated from the established RDCCA model for fault detection. To further classify the fault type, an FDA model is trained from the residual signals of different training faulty data sets. Simulations on a FOWT baseline model based on the widely used National Renewable Energy Laboratory FAST simulator are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed fault detection and classification method. Results have shown many salient features of the proposed method with potential applications in FOWTs.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a controller design for the electric pump of a deep-throttling rocket engine. The nonlinearity of the system is taken into consideration by analyzing the gap metric. Then, proportional-integral-derivative controller and gain-scheduling linear quadratic regulator are designed. Analyzing the amplitude- and phase-frequency characteristics as well as the pole-zero distribution of the system, the results show that the designed controllers can stabilize the linearized equations in incremental form at different operating points. This indicates that these two controllers are available for the original system in the whole range of working conditions and this is verified in the simulation. Meanwhile, the comparison between proportional-integral-derivative controller and gain-scheduling linear quadratic regulator is presented. It demonstrates that the proportional-integral-derivative controller is better at tracking both step and ramp signals but with worse control signals. It means that the proportional-integral-derivative controller seems less suitable for real use due to severe oscillations. Meanwhile, the parameter tuning of a proportional-integral-derivative controller depends on more extensive manual tuning. Therefore, the gain-scheduling linear quadratic regulator is preferred.},

	abstract = {Networked systems present some key new challenges in the development of fault diagnosis architectures. This paper proposes a novel distributed networked fault detection methodology for large-scale interconnected systems. The proposed formulation incorporates a synchronization methodology with a filtering approach in order to reduce the effect of measurement noise and time delays on the fault detection performance. The proposed approach allows the monitoring of multi-rate systems, where asynchronous and delayed measurements are available. This is achieved through the development of a virtual sensor scheme with a model-based re-synchronization algorithm and a delay compensation strategy for distributed fault diagnostic units. The monitoring architecture exploits an adaptive approximator with learning capabilities for handling uncertainties in the interconnection dynamics. A consensus-based estimator with timevarying weights is introduced, for improving fault detectability in the case of variables shared among more than one subsystem. Furthermore, time-varying threshold functions are designed to prevent false-positive alarms. Analytical fault detectability sufficient conditions are derived and extensive simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the distributed fault detection technique.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this paper, some new results on distributed fault diagnosis of continuous-time nonlinear systems with partial state measurements are proposed. By exploiting an overlapping decomposition framework, the dynamics of a nonlinear uncertain large-scale dynamical system is described as the interconnections of several subsystems. Each subsystem is monitored by a Local Fault Diagnoser: a set of local estimators, based on the nominal local dynamic model and on an adaptive approximation of the interconnection and of the fault function, allows to derive a local fault decision. A consensus-based protocol is used in order to improve the detectability and the isolability of faults affecting variables shared among different subsystems because of the overlapping decomposition. A sufficient condition ensuring the convergence of the estimation errors is derived. Finally, possibly non-conservative time-varying threshold functions guaranteeing no false-positive alarms and theoretical results dealing with detectability and isolability sufficient conditions are presented. },

	abstract = {The estimation of the rotor effective wind speed is used in modern wind turbines to provide advanced power and load control capabilities. However, with the ever increasing rotor sizes, the wind field over the rotor surface shows a higher degree of spatial variation. A single effective wind speed estimation therefore limits the attainable levels of load mitigation, and the estimation of the blade effective wind speed (BEWS) might present opportunities for improved load control. This letter introduces two novel BEWS estimator approaches: a proportional-integral-notch (PIN) estimator based on individual blade load measurements, and a Coleman estimator targeting the estimation in the nonrotating frame. Given the seeming disparities between these two estimators, the objective of this letter is to analyze the similarities between the approaches. It is shown that the PIN estimator, which is equivalent to the diagonal form of the Coleman estimator, is a simple but effective method to estimate the BEWS. The Coleman estimator, which takes the coupling effects between individual blades into account, shows a more well-behaved transient response than the PIN estimator.},

	abstract = {In networked control systems, leveraging the peculiarities of the cyber-physical domains and their interactions may lead to novel detection and defense mechanisms against malicious cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose a multiplicative sensor watermarking scheme, where each sensor's output is separately watermarked by a Single Input Single Output (SISO) filter. Hence, such scheme does not require communication between multiple sensors, but can still lead to detection and isolation of malicious cyber-attacks. In particular, we analyze the benefits of the proposed watermarking scheme for two attack scenarios: the physical sensor re-routing attack and the cyber measurement re-routing one. For each attack scenario, detectability and isolability properties are analyzed with and without the proposed watermarking scheme and we show how the watermarking scheme can be leveraged to detect cyber sensor routing attacks. In order to detect compromised sensors, we design an observer-based detector with a robust adaptive threshold. Additionally, we identify the sensors involved in the re-routing attacks by means of a tailored Recursive Least Squares parameter estimation algorithm. The results are illustrated through a numerical example.},

	abstract = {Traditional deterministic robust fault detection threshold designs, such as the norm-based or limit-checking method, are plagued by high conservativeness, which leads to poor fault detection performance. On one side they are ill-suited at tightly bounding the healthy residuals of uncertain nonlinear systems, as such residuals can take values in arbitrarily shaped, possibly non-convex regions. On the other hand, they must be robust even to worst-case, rare values of the modeling and measurement uncertainties. In order to maximize performance of detection, we propose two innovative ideas. First, we introduce threshold sets, parametrized in a way to bound arbitrarily well the residuals produced in healthy condition by an observer-based residual generator. Secondly, we formulate a chance-constrained cascade optimization problem to determine such a set, leading to optimal detection performance of a given class of faults, while guaranteeing robustness in a probabilistic sense. We then provide a computationally tractable framework by using randomization techniques, and a simulation analysis where a well-known three-tank benchmark system is considered.},

A stochastic modelbased framework for diagnosis is formulated. The system structural graph is decomposed into subsystems and each subsystem is monitored by one local diagnoser. It is shown that overlapping of subsystems allows to improve the detectability properties of the monitoring architecture. Based on this theoretical result, an optimal decomposition design method is proposed, able to define the minimum number of detection units needed to guarantee the detectability of certain faults while minimizing the communication costs subject to some computation cost constraints. An algorithmic procedure is presented to solve the proposed optimal decomposition problem. Preliminary simulation results show the potential of the proposed approach.},

Such a process is being increasingly promoted as a more viable alternative to the classic Blast Furnace for the production of iron from raw minerals. Due to the inherent complexity of the process and the reactor itself, its effective monitoring and control requires advanced mathematical models containing distributed-parameter components. While classical approaches such as Finite Element or Finite Differences are still reasonable options, for accuracy and computational efficiency reasons, an algebraic approach is proposed. A full multi-physical, albeit one-dimensional model is addressed and its accuracy is analysed. },

The proposed approach does not require full state measurements and is robust to measuring, modeling and numerical errors, thanks to a time varying detection threshold. In order to avoid the problems associated with classical discretization techniques for distributed parameter systems, which can lead to numerical errors difficult to bound a priori, and thus higher thresholds, a suitable structure-preserving algebraic approach, called Cell Method, will be employed. This method consists in writing the equations of a distributed parameter system directly in discrete form, avoiding the usual discretization process and leading to a symplectic, that is energy preserving, numerical scheme.},

The local detection decision is made on the basis of the knowledge of the local dynamic model and on an on-line-learned approximation of the dynamic influence of the neighboring sub-systems. The stability of the adaptive estimation scheme is rigorously investigated and sufficient fault detectability conditions are also proposed.
