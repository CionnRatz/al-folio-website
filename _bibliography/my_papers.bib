	abstract = {As renewable energy sources such as wind farms become dominant, new challenges emerge for operating and controlling them. Traditionally, wind farm control aims to dispatch power set-points to individual turbines to maximize energy extraction and, thus, their usage as assets. Yet, grid balance and frequency support are fundamental in presence of high renewable penetration and volatility of energy prices and demand. This requires a paradigm change, moving from power maximization to revenue maximization. In this paper, three active power control strategies pushing this shift of paradigm are investigated, namely: wake-loss compensation, thrust balancing, and load-limiting control.

The findings of large eddy simulations of a reference wind farm show that wake-loss compensation indeed improves the power generation on waked wind farms, but at the price of increased structural loads on certain turbines. The addition of a thrust balancing can equalize the stresses of individual turbines and their wear in the long term, while still attaining the required power output at the farm level. Furthermore, load-limiting controllers could potentially aid by allowing maintenance to be scheduled in a single time window, thus reducing operation and maintenance costs.},

	abstract = {In the next decade, further digitalisation of the entire wind energy project lifecycle is expected to be a major driver for reducing project costs and risks. In this paper, a literature review on the challenges related to implementation of digitalisation in the wind energy industry is first carried out, showing that there is a strong need for new solutions that enable co-innovation within and between organisations. Therefore, a new collaboration method based on a digital ecosystem is developed and demonstrated. The method is centred around specific ``challenges'', which are defined by ``challenge providers'' within a topical ``space'' and made available to participants via a digital platform. The data required in order to solve a particular ``challenge'' are provided by the ``challenge providers'' under the confidentiality conditions they specify. The method is demonstrated via a case study, the EDP Wind Turbine Fault Detection Challenge. Six submitted solutions using diverse approaches are evaluated. Two of the solutions perform significantly better than EDP's existing solution in terms of Total Prediction Costs (saving up to €120,000). The digital ecosystem is found to be a promising solution for enabling co-innovation in wind energy in general, providing a number of tangible benefits for both challenge and solution providers.},

We consider the LSS as a network of physically coupled subsystems, equipped with a two-layer controller: on the local level, decentralized controllers guarantee overall stability and reference tracking; on the supervisory level, a centralized coordinator sets references for the local regulators. We present a scheme to detect attacks that occur at the local level, with malicious agents capable of affecting the local control. The detection scheme is computed at the supervisory level, requiring only limited exchange of data and model knowledge. We offer detailed theoretical analysis of the proposed scheme, highlighting its detection properties in terms of robustness, detectability and stealthiness conditions.},

	title = {An Economic Model Predictive Control Approach for Load Mitigation on Multiple Tower Locations of Wind Turbines},
	year = {2022},
	abstract = {The current trend in the evolution of wind tur- bines is to increase their rotor size in order to capture more power. This leads to taller, slender and more flexible towers, which thus experience higher dynamical loads due to the tur- bine rotation and environmental factors. It is hence compelling to deploy advanced control methods that can dynamically counteract such loads, especially at tower positions that are more prone to develop cracks or corrosion damages. Still, to the best of the authors' knowledge, little to no attention has been paid in the literature to load mitigation at multiple tower locations. Furthermore, there is a need for control schemes that can balance load reduction with optimization of power production. In this paper, we develop an Economic Model Predictive Control (eMPC) framework to address such needs. First, we develop a linear modal model to account for the tower flexural dynamics. Then we incorporate it into an eMPC framework, where the dynamics of the turbine rotation are expressed in energy terms. This allows us to obtain a convex formulation, that is computationally attractive. Our control law is designed to avoid the ``turn-pike'' behavior and guarantee recursive feasibility. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller on a 5MW reference WT model: the results illustrate that the proposed controller is able to reduce the tower loads at multiple locations, without significant effects to the generated power.},

Using FHE in control thus has the advantage that control effort for a plant can be calculated remotely without ever decrypting the exchanged information. FHE in its current form is however not practically applicable for real-time control as its computational load is very high compared to traditional encryption methods. In this paper a reformulation of the Gentry FHE scheme is proposed and applied on an FPGA to solve this problem. It is shown that the resulting FHE scheme can be implemented for real-time stabilization of an inverted double pendulum using discrete time control.},

	year = {2022},
	abstract = {Wind turbine (WT) controllers are often geared towards maximum power extraction, while suitable operating constraints should be guaranteed such that WT components are protected from failures. Control strategies can be also devised to reduce the generated power, for instance to track a power reference provided by the grid operator. They are called down- regulation strategies and allow to balance power generation and grid loads, as well as to provide ancillary grid services, such as frequency regulation. Although this balance is limited by the wind availability and grid demand, the quality of wind energy can be improved by introducing down-regulation strategies that make use of the kinetic energy of the turbine dynamics. This paper shows how the kinetic energy in the rotating components of turbines can be used as an additional degree-of-freedom by different down-regulation strategies. In particular we explore the power tracking problem based on convex model predictive control (MPC) at a single wind turbine. The use of MPC allows us to introduce a further constraint that guarantees flow stability and avoids stall conditions. Simulation results are used to illustrate the performance of the developed down- regulation strategies. Notably, by maximizing rotor speeds, and thus kinetic energy, the turbine can still temporarily guarantee tracking of a given power reference even when occasional saturation of the available wind power occurs. In the study case we proved that our approach can guarantee power tracking in saturated conditions for 10 times longer than with traditional down-regulation strategies.

Recently, it has been demonstrated as a promising approach for constructing goal-driven behavior in robotics. Specifically, the active inference controller (AIC) has been successful on several continuous control and state-estimation tasks. Despite its relative success, some established design choices lead to a number of practical limitations for robot control. These include having a biased estimate of the state, and only an implicit model of control actions. In this paper, we highlight these limitations and propose an extended version of the unbiased active inference controller (u-AIC). The u-AIC maintains all the compelling benefits of the AIC and removes its limitations. Simulation results on a 2-DOF arm and experiments on a real 7-DOF manipulator show the improved performance of the u-AIC with respect to the standard AIC.

	abstract = {Wind turbines are prone to structural degradation, particularly in offshore locations. Based on the structural health condition of the tower, power de-rating strategies can be used to reduce structural loads at the cost of power losses. This paper introduces a novel closed-loop switching control architecture to constrain the thrust in individual turbines. By taking inspiration from developments in the field of reference governors, an existing demanded power tracking controller is extended by a thrust tracking controller. The latter is activated only when a user-defined constraint on fore-aft thrust force is exceeded, which can be set based on the actual damage status of the turbine. Having a down-regulation with monotonic aerodynamic load response, a simple linear thrust tracking controller is proposed. Such a scheme can reduce aerodynamic loads while incurring acceptable losses on power production which, in a wind farm setting, can be compensated for by other turbines. Large eddy simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme on satisfying thrust constraints.},

	abstract = {Individual Pitch Control (IPC) is an effective control strategy to mitigate the blade loads on large-scale wind turbines. Since IPC usually requires high pitch actuation, the safety constraints of the pitch actuator should be taken into account when designing the controller. This paper introduces a constrained Subspace Predictive Repetitive Control (SPRC) approach, which considers the limitation of blade pitch angle and pitch rate. To fulfill this goal, a model predictive control scheme is implemented in the fully data-driven SPRC approach to incorporate the physical limitations of the pitch actuator in the control problem formulation. An optimal control law subjected to constraints is then formulated so that future constraint violations are anticipated and prevented. Case studies show that the developed constrained SPRC reduces the pitch activities necessary to mitigate the blade loads when experiencing wind turbulence and abrupt wind gusts. More importantly, the approach allows the wind farm operator to design conservative bounds for the pitch actuator constraints that satisfies safety limitations, design specifications and physical restrictions. This will help to alleviate the cyclic fatigue loads on the actuators, increase the structural reliability and extend the lifespan of the pitch control system.},

	year = {2022},
	abstract = {The wind turbine side-side tower motion is known to be lightly damped. One viable active damping solution is realized by deploying individual pitch control (IPC) such that counteracting blade forces are created to alleviate the tower fatigue loading caused by this motion. Existing IPC methods for side-side tower damping in the literature, such as linear quadratic regulator and lead-lag controller, cannot accommodate direct optimization and trade- off tunings of the wind turbine economic performance. In this work, a novel side-side tower damping IPC strategy under a convex economic model predictive control (CEMPC) framework is therefore developed to address these challenges. The main idea of the framework lies in the variable transformation in power and energy terms to obtain linear dynamics and convex constraints, over which the economic performance of the wind turbine is maximized with a globally optimal solution in a receding horizon manner. The effectiveness of the proposed method is showcased in a high-fidelity simulation environment under both steady and turbulent wind cases. Lower fatigue damage on the side-side tower bending moment is attained with an acceptable level of pitch activities, negligible impact on the blade loads, and minor improvement on the power production.},

	abstract = {The estimation of the rotor effective wind speed is used in modern wind turbines to provide advanced power and load control capabilities. However, with the ever increasing rotor sizes, the wind field over the rotor surface shows a higher degree of spatial variation. A single effective wind speed estimation therefore limits the attainable levels of load mitigation, and the estimation of the Blade Effective Wind Speed (BEWS) might present opportunities for improved load control. This letter introduces two novel BEWS estimator approaches: A Proportional Integral Notch (PIN) estimator based on individual blade load measurements, and a Coleman estimator targeting the estimation in the non-rotating frame. Given the seeming disparities between these two estimators, the objective of this letter is to analyze the similarities between the approaches. It is shown that the PIN estimator, which is equivalent to the diagonal form of the Coleman estimator, is a simple but effective method to estimate the BEWS. The Coleman estimator, which takes the coupling effects between individual blades into account, shows a more well behaved transient response than the PIN estimator.},

We will describe its convenience with respect to more traditional, application-specific optical measuring approaches, and provide three real-world examples:
* an overview of a full system with tight deployment constraints, to show how the Q-VID modules can be deployed in out-of-reach plant infrastructure in a distributed fashion with no particular efforts;
* a case study for standard cameras chassis, to guarantee the components operability even in harsh conditions, such as high temperatures, dust and vibrations;
* a software framework, common to all the Q-VID products, which shapes several applications, and allows to meet the expected performance and reliability.},

	abstract = {Abstract Over the past decades, Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) has gained increasing attention in wind engineering due to the rapidly growing energy demands. However, difficulties in turbine maintenance will increase due to the harsh operational conditions. Fault diagnosis techniques play a crucial role to enhance the reliability of FOWTs and reduce the cost of offshore wind energy. In this paper, a novel data-driven fault diagnosis method using regularized dynamic canonical correlation analysis (RDCCA) and Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) is proposed for FOWTs. Specifically, to overcome the collinearity problem that exists in measured process data, dynamic canonical correlation analysis with a regularization scheme, is developed to exploit the relationship between input and output signals. Then, the residual signals are generated from the established RDCCA model for fault detection. To further classify the fault type, an FDA model is trained from the residual signals of different training faulty data sets. Simulations on a FOWT baseline model based on the widely used National Renewable Energy Laboratory FAST simulator are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed fault detection and classification method. Results have shown many salient features of the proposed method with potential applications in FOWTs.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a controller design for the electric pump of a deep-throttling rocket engine. The nonlinearity of the system is taken into consideration by analyzing the gap metric. Then, proportional-integral-derivative controller and gain-scheduling linear quadratic regulator are designed. Analyzing the amplitude- and phase-frequency characteristics as well as the pole-zero distribution of the system, the results show that the designed controllers can stabilize the linearized equations in incremental form at different operating points. This indicates that these two controllers are available for the original system in the whole range of working conditions and this is verified in the simulation. Meanwhile, the comparison between proportional-integral-derivative controller and gain-scheduling linear quadratic regulator is presented. It demonstrates that the proportional-integral-derivative controller is better at tracking both step and ramp signals but with worse control signals. It means that the proportional-integral-derivative controller seems less suitable for real use due to severe oscillations. Meanwhile, the parameter tuning of a proportional-integral-derivative controller depends on more extensive manual tuning. Therefore, the gain-scheduling linear quadratic regulator is preferred.},

	abstract = {Networked systems present some key new challenges in the development of fault diagnosis architectures. This paper proposes a novel distributed networked fault detection methodology for large-scale interconnected systems. The proposed formulation incorporates a synchronization methodology with a filtering approach in order to reduce the effect of measurement noise and time delays on the fault detection performance. The proposed approach allows the monitoring of multi-rate systems, where asynchronous and delayed measurements are available. This is achieved through the development of a virtual sensor scheme with a model-based re-synchronization algorithm and a delay compensation strategy for distributed fault diagnostic units. The monitoring architecture exploits an adaptive approximator with learning capabilities for handling uncertainties in the interconnection dynamics. A consensus-based estimator with timevarying weights is introduced, for improving fault detectability in the case of variables shared among more than one subsystem. Furthermore, time-varying threshold functions are designed to prevent false-positive alarms. Analytical fault detectability sufficient conditions are derived and extensive simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the distributed fault detection technique.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this paper, some new results on distributed fault diagnosis of continuous-time nonlinear systems with partial state measurements are proposed. By exploiting an overlapping decomposition framework, the dynamics of a nonlinear uncertain large-scale dynamical system is described as the interconnections of several subsystems. Each subsystem is monitored by a Local Fault Diagnoser: a set of local estimators, based on the nominal local dynamic model and on an adaptive approximation of the interconnection and of the fault function, allows to derive a local fault decision. A consensus-based protocol is used in order to improve the detectability and the isolability of faults affecting variables shared among different subsystems because of the overlapping decomposition. A sufficient condition ensuring the convergence of the estimation errors is derived. Finally, possibly non-conservative time-varying threshold functions guaranteeing no false-positive alarms and theoretical results dealing with detectability and isolability sufficient conditions are presented. },

	year = {2022},
	abstract = {The estimation of the rotor effective wind speed is used in modern wind turbines to provide advanced power and load control capabilities. However, with the ever increasing rotor sizes, the wind field over the rotor surface shows a higher degree of spatial variation. A single effective wind speed estimation therefore limits the attainable levels of load mitigation, and the estimation of the blade effective wind speed (BEWS) might present opportunities for improved load control. This letter introduces two novel BEWS estimator approaches: a proportional-integral-notch (PIN) estimator based on individual blade load measurements, and a Coleman estimator targeting the estimation in the nonrotating frame. Given the seeming disparities between these two estimators, the objective of this letter is to analyze the similarities between the approaches. It is shown that the PIN estimator, which is equivalent to the diagonal form of the Coleman estimator, is a simple but effective method to estimate the BEWS. The Coleman estimator, which takes the coupling effects between individual blades into account, shows a more well-behaved transient response than the PIN estimator.},

The proposed design enhances power tracking stability and allows for simple understanding, where each turbine is considered as a pure time-delay system. The paper investigates the control performance with different nominal power distributions in a fully waked condition and limited power availability. Results demonstrate the improvement in power production obtained by closing the control loop, compared to greedy operation. Additionally, power tracking capabilities are enhanced with a nominal power distribution favored by axial-induction, as well as the occurrence of turbine saturation and the distribution of loads.},

	abstract = {Model-based fault-tolerant control (FTC) often consists of two distinct steps: fault detection & isolation (FDI), and fault accommodation. In this work we investigate posing fault- tolerant control as a single Bayesian inference problem. Previous work showed that precision learning allows for stochastic FTC without an explicit fault detection step. While this leads to implicit fault recovery, information on sensor faults is not provided, which may be essential for triggering other impact-mitigation actions. In this paper, we introduce a precision-learning based Bayesian FTC approach and a novel beta residual for fault detection. Simulation results are presented, supporting the use of beta residual against competing approaches.},

	abstract = {In networked control systems, leveraging the peculiarities of the cyber-physical domains and their interactions may lead to novel detection and defense mechanisms against malicious cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose a multiplicative sensor watermarking scheme, where each sensor's output is separately watermarked by a Single Input Single Output (SISO) filter. Hence, such scheme does not require communication between multiple sensors, but can still lead to detection and isolation of malicious cyber-attacks. In particular, we analyze the benefits of the proposed watermarking scheme for two attack scenarios: the physical sensor re-routing attack and the cyber measurement re-routing one. For each attack scenario, detectability and isolability properties are analyzed with and without the proposed watermarking scheme and we show how the watermarking scheme can be leveraged to detect cyber sensor routing attacks. In order to detect compromised sensors, we design an observer-based detector with a robust adaptive threshold. Additionally, we identify the sensors involved in the re-routing attacks by means of a tailored Recursive Least Squares parameter estimation algorithm. The results are illustrated through a numerical example.},

	abstract = {Traditional deterministic robust fault detection threshold designs, such as the norm-based or limit-checking method, are plagued by high conservativeness, which leads to poor fault detection performance. On one side they are ill-suited at tightly bounding the healthy residuals of uncertain nonlinear systems, as such residuals can take values in arbitrarily shaped, possibly non-convex regions. On the other hand, they must be robust even to worst-case, rare values of the modeling and measurement uncertainties. In order to maximize performance of detection, we propose two innovative ideas. First, we introduce threshold sets, parametrized in a way to bound arbitrarily well the residuals produced in healthy condition by an observer-based residual generator. Secondly, we formulate a chance-constrained cascade optimization problem to determine such a set, leading to optimal detection performance of a given class of faults, while guaranteeing robustness in a probabilistic sense. We then provide a computationally tractable framework by using randomization techniques, and a simulation analysis where a well-known three-tank benchmark system is considered.},

	abstract = {Abstract The paper deals with the problem of defining the optimal topology for a distributed fault detection architecture for non-linear large-scale systems. A stochastic modelbased framework for diagnosis is formulated. The system structural graph is decomposed into subsystems and each subsystem is monitored by one local diagnoser. It is shown that overlapping of subsystems allows to improve the detectability properties of the monitoring architecture. Based on this theoretical result, an optimal decomposition design method is proposed, able to define the minimum number of detection units needed to guarantee the detectability of certain faults while minimizing the communication costs subject to some computation cost constraints. An algorithmic procedure is presented to solve the proposed optimal decomposition problem. Preliminary simulation results show the potential of the proposed approach.},

Such a process is being increasingly promoted as a more viable alternative to the classic Blast Furnace for the production of iron from raw minerals. Due to the inherent complexity of the process and the reactor itself, its effective monitoring and control requires advanced mathematical models containing distributed-parameter components. While classical approaches such as Finite Element or Finite Differences are still reasonable options, for accuracy and computational efficiency reasons, an algebraic approach is proposed. A full multi-physical, albeit one-dimensional model is addressed and its accuracy is analysed. },

The proposed approach does not require full state measurements and is robust to measuring, modeling and numerical errors, thanks to a time varying detection threshold. In order to avoid the problems associated with classical discretization techniques for distributed parameter systems, which can lead to numerical errors difficult to bound a priori, and thus higher thresholds, a suitable structure-preserving algebraic approach, called Cell Method, will be employed. This method consists in writing the equations of a distributed parameter system directly in discrete form, avoiding the usual discretization process and leading to a symplectic, that is energy preserving, numerical scheme.},

A novel consensus-based estimator with time-varying weights is introduced, permitting to improve detectability in the case of variables shared among more than one subsystem. In the consensus protocol, at each step each agent uses only the information given by the agent and the communication link which are more reliable at that time. The convergence of the proposed estimator is demonstrated and analytical conditions for detectability are derived.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of designing a fault detection scheme for a distributed nonlinear dynamic system. A network of distributed estimators is constructed where an adaptive estimator based on an on-line neural approximation model is embedded into each estimation agent. The local detection decision is made on the basis of the knowledge of the local dynamic model and on an on-line-learned approximation of the dynamic influence of the neighboring sub-systems. The stability of the adaptive estimation scheme is rigorously investigated and sufficient fault detectability conditions are also proposed. Simulation results are finally provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and methodology},
