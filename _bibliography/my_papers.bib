	abstract = {Abstract Over the past decades, Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) has gained increasing attention in wind engineering due to the rapidly growing energy demands. However, difficulties in turbine maintenance will increase due to the harsh operational conditions. Fault diagnosis techniques play a crucial role to enhance the reliability of FOWTs and reduce the cost of offshore wind energy. In this paper, a novel data-driven fault diagnosis method using regularized dynamic canonical correlation analysis (RDCCA) and Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) is proposed for FOWTs. Specifically, to overcome the collinearity problem that exists in measured process data, dynamic canonical correlation analysis with a regularization scheme, is developed to exploit the relationship between input and output signals. Then, the residual signals are generated from the established RDCCA model for fault detection. To further classify the fault type, an FDA model is trained from the residual signals of different training faulty data sets. Simulations on a FOWT baseline model based on the widely used National Renewable Energy Laboratory FAST simulator are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed fault detection and classification method. Results have shown many salient features of the proposed method with potential applications in FOWTs.},

	year = {2017},
	abstract = {Networked systems present some key new challenges in the development of fault diagnosis architectures. This paper proposes a novel distributed networked fault detection methodology for large-scale interconnected systems. The proposed formulation incorporates a synchronization methodology with a filtering approach in order to reduce the effect of measurement noise and time delays on the fault detection performance. The proposed approach allows the monitoring of multi-rate systems, where asynchronous and delayed measurements are available. This is achieved through the development of a virtual sensor scheme with a model-based re-synchronization algorithm and a delay compensation strategy for distributed fault diagnostic units. The monitoring architecture exploits an adaptive approximator with learning capabilities for handling uncertainties in the interconnection dynamics. A consensus-based estimator with timevarying weights is introduced, for improving fault detectability in the case of variables shared among more than one subsystem. Furthermore, time-varying threshold functions are designed to prevent false-positive alarms. Analytical fault detectability sufficient conditions are derived and extensive simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the distributed fault detection technique.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a controller design for the electric pump of a deep-throttling rocket engine. The nonlinearity of the system is taken into consideration by analyzing the gap metric. Then, proportional-integral-derivative controller and gain-scheduling linear quadratic regulator are designed. Analyzing the amplitude- and phase-frequency characteristics as well as the pole-zero distribution of the system, the results show that the designed controllers can stabilize the linearized equations in incremental form at different operating points. This indicates that these two controllers are available for the original system in the whole range of working conditions and this is verified in the simulation. Meanwhile, the comparison between proportional-integral-derivative controller and gain-scheduling linear quadratic regulator is presented. It demonstrates that the proportional-integral-derivative controller is better at tracking both step and ramp signals but with worse control signals. It means that the proportional-integral-derivative controller seems less suitable for real use due to severe oscillations. Meanwhile, the parameter tuning of a proportional-integral-derivative controller depends on more extensive manual tuning. Therefore, the gain-scheduling linear quadratic regulator is preferred.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this paper, some new results on distributed fault diagnosis of continuous-time nonlinear systems with partial state measurements are proposed. By exploiting an overlapping decomposition framework, the dynamics of a nonlinear uncertain large-scale dynamical system is described as the interconnections of several subsystems. Each subsystem is monitored by a Local Fault Diagnoser: a set of local estimators, based on the nominal local dynamic model and on an adaptive approximation of the interconnection and of the fault function, allows to derive a local fault decision. A consensus-based protocol is used in order to improve the detectability and the isolability of faults affecting variables shared among different subsystems because of the overlapping decomposition. A sufficient condition ensuring the convergence of the estimation errors is derived. Finally, possibly non-conservative time-varying threshold functions guaranteeing no false-positive alarms and theoretical results dealing with detectability and isolability sufficient conditions are presented. },

The monitored system is modeled as the interconnection of several subsystems and a divide et impera approach using an overlapping decomposition is adopted. Each subsystem is monitored by a Local Fault Diagnoser using the information based on the measured local state of the subsystem as well as the measurements about neighboring states thanks to the subsystem interconnections. The local diagnostic decision is made on the basis of the knowledge of the local subsystem dynamic model and of an adaptive approximation of the interconnection with neighboring subsystems. In order to improve the detectability and isolability of faults affecting variables shared among different subsystems, a consensus-based estimator is designed. Theoretical results are provided to characterize the detection and isolation capabilities of the proposed distributed scheme. },

The major topic this machine has to face off is the flexibility.

We will describe its convenience with respect to more traditional, application-specific optical measuring approaches, and provide three real-world examples:
* an overview of a full system with tight deployment constraints, to show how the Q-VID modules can be deployed in out-of-reach plant infrastructure in a distributed fashion with no particular efforts;
* a case study for standard cameras chassis, to guarantee the components operability even in harsh conditions, such as high temperatures, dust and vibrations;
* a software framework, common to all the Q-VID products, which shapes several applications, and allows to meet the expected performance and reliability.},

A network of distributed estimators is constructed where an adaptive estimator based on an on-line neural approximation model is embedded into each estimation agent. The local detection decision is made on the basis of the knowledge of the local dynamic model and on an on-line-learned approximation of the dynamic influence of the neighboring sub-systems. The stability of the adaptive estimation scheme is rigorously investigated and sufficient fault detectability conditions are also proposed. Simulation results are finally provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and methodology},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of building a distributed fault detection architecture for large-scale dynamical systems that are modelled as the interconnection of several subsystems. The subsystems are allowed to overlap, thus sharing some state components. For each subsystem a local fault detector is built, such that it can measure the local state of its subsystem as well as receive through communication links a measure of the neighboring states. The local detection decision is made on the basis of the knowledge of the local subsystem dynamic model and of an adaptively learned approximation of the interconnection with neighbouring subsystems.

	abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of designing a robust fault detection methodology for a class of input-output, uncertain dynamical distributed parameter systems, namely mechanical elastodynamic systems, which are representative of a whole class of problems related to on-line health monitoring of mechanical and civil engineering structures. The proposed approach does not require full state measurements and is robust to measuring, modeling and numerical errors, thanks to a time varying detection threshold. In order to avoid the problems associated with classical discretization techniques for distributed parameter systems, which can lead to numerical errors difficult to bound a priori, and thus higher thresholds, a suitable structure-preserving algebraic approach, called Cell Method, will be employed. This method consists in writing the equations of a distributed parameter system directly in discrete form, avoiding the usual discretization process and leading to a symplectic, that is energy preserving, numerical scheme.},

Such a process is being increasingly promoted as a more viable alternative to the classic Blast Furnace for the production of iron from raw minerals. Due to the inherent complexity of the process and the reactor itself, its effective monitoring and control requires advanced mathematical models containing distributed-parameter components. While classical approaches such as Finite Element or Finite Differences are still reasonable options, for accuracy and computational efficiency reasons, an algebraic approach is proposed. A full multi-physical, albeit one-dimensional model is addressed and its accuracy is analysed. },

A stochastic modelbased framework for diagnosis is formulated. The system structural graph is decomposed into subsystems and each subsystem is monitored by one local diagnoser. It is shown that overlapping of subsystems allows to improve the detectability properties of the monitoring architecture. Based on this theoretical result, an optimal decomposition design method is proposed, able to define the minimum number of detection units needed to guarantee the detectability of certain faults while minimizing the communication costs subject to some computation cost constraints. An algorithmic procedure is presented to solve the proposed optimal decomposition problem. Preliminary simulation results show the potential of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Traditional deterministic robust fault detection threshold designs, such as the norm-based or limit-checking method, are plagued by high conservativeness, which leads to poor fault detection performance. On one side they are ill-suited at tightly bounding the healthy residuals of uncertain nonlinear systems, as such residuals can take values in arbitrarily shaped, possibly non-convex regions. On the other hand, they must be robust even to worst-case, rare values of the modeling and measurement uncertainties. In order to maximize performance of detection, we propose two innovative ideas. First, we introduce threshold sets, parametrized in a way to bound arbitrarily well the residuals produced in healthy condition by an observer-based residual generator. Secondly, we formulate a chance-constrained cascade optimization problem to determine such a set, leading to optimal detection performance of a given class of faults, while guaranteeing robustness in a probabilistic sense. We then provide a computationally tractable framework by using randomization techniques, and a simulation analysis where a well-known three-tank benchmark system is considered.},

	abstract = {In networked control systems, leveraging the peculiarities of the cyber-physical domains and their interactions may lead to novel detection and defense mechanisms against malicious cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose a multiplicative sensor watermarking scheme, where each sensor's output is separately watermarked by a Single Input Single Output (SISO) filter. Hence, such scheme does not require communication between multiple sensors, but can still lead to detection and isolation of malicious cyber-attacks. In particular, we analyze the benefits of the proposed watermarking scheme for two attack scenarios: the physical sensor re-routing attack and the cyber measurement re-routing one. For each attack scenario, detectability and isolability properties are analyzed with and without the proposed watermarking scheme and we show how the watermarking scheme can be leveraged to detect cyber sensor routing attacks. In order to detect compromised sensors, we design an observer-based detector with a robust adaptive threshold. Additionally, we identify the sensors involved in the re-routing attacks by means of a tailored Recursive Least Squares parameter estimation algorithm. The results are illustrated through a numerical example.},
