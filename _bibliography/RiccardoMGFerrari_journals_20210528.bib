	volume = {62},
	year = {2017},
	abstract = {Networked systems present some key new challenges in the development of fault diagnosis architectures. This paper proposes a novel distributed networked fault detection methodology for large-scale interconnected systems. The proposed formulation incorporates a synchronization methodology with a filtering approach in order to reduce the effect of measurement noise and time delays on the fault detection performance. The proposed approach allows the monitoring of multi-rate systems, where asynchronous and delayed measurements are available. This is achieved through the development of a virtual sensor scheme with a model-based re-synchronization algorithm and a delay compensation strategy for distributed fault diagnostic units. The monitoring architecture exploits an adaptive approximator with learning capabilities for handling uncertainties in the interconnection dynamics. A consensus-based estimator with timevarying weights is introduced, for improving fault detectability in the case of variables shared among more than one subsystem. Furthermore, time-varying threshold functions are designed to prevent false-positive alarms. Analytical fault detectability sufficient conditions are derived and extensive simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the distributed fault detection technique.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a controller design for the electric pump of a deep-throttling rocket engine. The nonlinearity of the system is taken into consideration by analyzing the gap metric. Then, proportional-integral-derivative controller and gain-scheduling linear quadratic regulator are designed. Analyzing the amplitude- and phase-frequency characteristics as well as the pole-zero distribution of the system, the results show that the designed controllers can stabilize the linearized equations in incremental form at different operating points. This indicates that these two controllers are available for the original system in the whole range of working conditions and this is verified in the simulation. Meanwhile, the comparison between proportional-integral-derivative controller and gain-scheduling linear quadratic regulator is presented. It demonstrates that the proportional-integral-derivative controller is better at tracking both step and ramp signals but with worse control signals. It means that the proportional-integral-derivative controller seems less suitable for real use due to severe oscillations. Meanwhile, the parameter tuning of a proportional-integral-derivative controller depends on more extensive manual tuning. Therefore, the gain-scheduling linear quadratic regulator is preferred.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this paper, some new results on distributed fault diagnosis of continuous-time nonlinear systems with partial state measurements are proposed. By exploiting an overlapping decomposition framework, the dynamics of a nonlinear uncertain large-scale dynamical system is described as the interconnections of several subsystems. Each subsystem is monitored by a Local Fault Diagnoser: a set of local estimators, based on the nominal local dynamic model and on an adaptive approximation of the interconnection and of the fault function, allows to derive a local fault decision. A consensus-based protocol is used in order to improve the detectability and the isolability of faults affecting variables shared among different subsystems because of the overlapping decomposition. A sufficient condition ensuring the convergence of the estimation errors is derived. Finally, possibly non-conservative time-varying threshold functions guaranteeing no false-positive alarms and theoretical results dealing with detectability and isolability sufficient conditions are presented. },
