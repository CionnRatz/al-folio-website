	abstract = {Torch and saw cutting may lead to burrs in rolled products (slabs, blooms, billets) at the trimmed edge, which have to be cleared to guarantee defect-free further processing. A fully automated deburring robot is here proposed, which uses 3D stereo vision and machine learning techniques to localize the billet profile with 6 DoF. The major topic this machine has to face off is the flexibility. One standard, though customizable, machine has to deburr a large amount of different shapes (round, square, etc.), randomly positioned and up to a productivity of 90 t/h.},

	abstract = {Vision-based applications are emerging as a new trend in the steelmaking industry, being exploited in a wide range of situations due to their advantageous tradeoff between deployment flexibility, cost and quality. Here we present a new instrumentation systems family , named Q-V I D , capable of accurate measurements of hot and cold products by groundbreaking and robust computer vision techniques, specifically designed to fit accuracy and real-time constraints.
We will describe its convenience with respect to more traditional, application-specific optical measuring approaches, and provide three real-world examples:
* an overview of a full system with tight deployment constraints, to show how the Q-VID modules can be deployed in out-of-reach plant infrastructure in a distributed fashion with no particular efforts;
* a case study for standard cameras chassis, to guarantee the components operability even in harsh conditions, such as high temperatures, dust and vibrations;
* a software framework, common to all the Q-VID products, which shapes several applications, and allows to meet the expected performance and reliability.},
