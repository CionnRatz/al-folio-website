<u>Description:</u> The project is dedicated to ensuring the reliable and cost-effective design and operation of wind power plants, with a specific emphasis on system stability, security, and environmental considerations. This involves the pivotal role of coordinated solutions for wind farm control and asset management. 

TWAIN aligns with ambitious decarbonization goals, acknowledging the transformative influence of powerful catalysts such as artificial intelligence (AI) and digitalization, driving the energy transition, and enabling the integration of wind farm control technology processes into the operation and design of future energy systems.

The project's goals are:

1. To develop a modern data collection and analysis environment for the TWAIN workflow.
2. To digitalise, validate, and incorporate the prediction tools for the relevant processes of wind farm control.
3. To quantify the economic, social and environmental implications and risks for a series of industrially critical case studies.
4. To optimise multi-objective, value-based WFC, through multi-level controller integration and related WF design.
5. To facilitate testing and adoption of the open-source TWAIN decision support environment for wind power asset management.
