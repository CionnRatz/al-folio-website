<u>Description:</u> Europe is committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2050, emphasizing energy independence and security. With wind energy expected to play a pivotal role in renewable energy, optimizing large offshore wind farms through advanced control systems is crucial.
 
Therefore, the next generation of wind farms must evolve into dispatchable systems, meeting energy demands reliably while considering broader environmental and societal impacts. Current wind farm control technologies, as seen in off-shore wind farms, present untapped opportunities within the vast data they generate. Leveraging artificial intelligence, especially machine learning and data mining, opens avenues for data-enabled modeling, monitoring, and decision-making, facilitating the transition toward interoperable and dispatchable wind energy systems. However, this digital evolution also exposes our power supply to increased vulnerability from digital threats.

While prior projects concentrated on advancing diverse flow control technologies to optimize individual economic objectives, SUDOCO aims to unify various elements, proactively considering fluctuating external factors such as atmospheric conditions, wind speed, electricity prices, as well as the environmental impact and the security of energy delivery.

The project's goals are:

1. Implement farm-wide flow control for wind turbines to optimize the balance between energy yield and structural load, potentially reducing  costs by up to 10%.
2. Develop a monitoring and control system to align wind farm costs with yield, aiming for a 10% reduction in the Cost of Valued Energy (COVE) metric.
3. Optimize the entire wind farm system to decrease lifetime CO2-equivalent emissions by 20%, addressing environmental impacts beyond green energy production.
4. Enhance (cyber)security to ensure an uninterrupted energy supply, aligning with EU directives and mitigating the impact of physical and cyber threats to less than 10% of baseline values.
