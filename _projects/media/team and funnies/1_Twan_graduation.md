PhDs graduation ceremonies at TU Delft are elaborate and suggestive. Both the candidate and the supervisor (as well as all the other members from the graduation committee) have to dress *properly*.

<!-- You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images. -->
