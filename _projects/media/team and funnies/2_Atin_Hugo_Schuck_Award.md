Our PhD student Atindriyo Pamososuryo, cosupervised with J.W. van Wingerden, received the prestigious O. Hugo Schuck prize from the American Automatic Control Council! The prize is assigned to the best theoretical and, respectively, application paper from previous American Control Conference.
We were awarded in the application category thanks to our paper

>  *"Periodic Load Estimation of a Wind Turbine Tower using a Model Demodulation Transformation," by Pamososuryo, Atindriyo Kusumo and Mulders, Sebastiaan P. and Ferrari, Riccardo M.G. and van Wingerden, Jan-Willem.*


The prize money and the award plaques for all the authors were received at this year ACC by J.W. van Wingerden and Sebastiaan Mulders, which co-authored the paper.

I am extremely proud of Atin for this prize, which is very well deserved and testified of his high qualities and hard working attitude. Go Atin!
