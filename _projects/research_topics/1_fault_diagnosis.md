Joint work with: xx, yy, zz.

## Motivation

* General motivation on making systems safe and reliable. Just making them work is not enough for critical systems such as
   - transportation (cars, trains, airplanes, ...)
   - fundamental infrastructures such as power grid, road networks, communication netoworks, ...
   - industrial processes with high stored energy such as nuclear, chemical, steelmaking, etc ...
* While avoiding catastrophic failures in one of the examples above is of paramount importance, on the long run also smaller faults and breakdowns should be minimized. Let us take, for example, the xx sector and look at its Operation&Maintenance cost, which is part of the so called Opex cost, that is the amount of money that must be spent on top of the Capex (the cost of actually making and installing it). Well, there the O&M can be up to yy % of the total (reference to the source). So, every cent that we can safe by better diagnosing the onset of faults and thus optimizing maintenance, is a cent that helps reducing the total cost of energy produced by a xx, thus making renewable energy even more sustainable (ref. to another source).
