I am a Marie Curie Alumnus and an Assistant Professor in Fault Tolerant Control at the Delft Center for Systems and Control, within the Faculty of Mechanical, Maritime, and Materials Engineering (3mE) at [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl/en){:target="\_blank"}. I took an unusual career path leading, after a PhD in Information Engineering form the [University of Trieste](http://www.units.it/en){:target="\_blank"}, to spend 7 years in industrial R&D at [Danieli Automation](https://www.dca.it/en){:target="\_blank"}. There I specialized in instrumentation and automation solutions for process control in the steelmaking sector, at researcher and executive manager level. 
** add something here about coming back to academia after this stint, say thank you to MSCA and other funding, explain **
My current research interests include fault and cyber attack diagnosis and tolerance for distributed systems, with applications to autonomous robots formations and wind farms.
** Maybe make this a bit more up to date **
I received a BA in Classical Piano from the Conservatory of Trieste (Italy), the city where I was born in 1979.

In my free time, I enjoy(ed) bike touring around Europe, skating, jazz music and Aikido. You can read a CV of mine ** add PDF and link **, as well as some more information about my hobbies ** add page and link **.
