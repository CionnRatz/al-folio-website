Are you a highly motivated, uncompromising enquirer that is aiming for a PhD or a Postdoc in our lab? Are you interested in making complex dynamical systems safe and reliable? Would you like to explore how to implement efficient encryption methods in real-time control systems, or how to identify models of highly nonlinear phenomena such as lithium ion batteries? Would you like to bring a theoretical breakthrough to our field, or demonstrate state-of-the art algorithms in a demanding laboratory or real life experiment?

Then you should join us! Do not hesitate to [write me](mailto:r.ferrari@tudelft.nl) for information on available positions.
